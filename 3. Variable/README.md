# Variable
Variables are containers for storing data values.
```
x = 10
y = "Ravi"
print(x)
print(y)
```

## Variable names are case-sensitive.
```
a = 4
A = "Sally"
#A will not overwrite a
```

## Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
```
x = 10      # x is of type int
x = "Ravi" # x is now of type str
print(x)
```

# Casting
If we want to specify the datatype of a variable, this can be done with casting.
```
x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0
```

# Get the Type
You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.
```
x = 5
y = "John"
print(type(x))  # Display datatype of x: Integer
print(type(y))  # Display datatype of x: String
````

# Single or Double Quotes

String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:
```
x = "John" # Both are the same
x = 'John'
```
